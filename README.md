# Java Tutorial ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Phase&message=In%20Development&color=blueviolet&style=flat&logo=appveyor)

Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once,run anywhere (WORA), meaning that
compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee, the coffee from Indonesia. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.
